## Welcome to Human Services Project!

This project evaluate self-suffiency measurement that Human Services current use and develop machine learning models to predict risk of return for IL SNAP and TANF recipients and extract a better metrics for self-suffiency measurement. 

### Part I Evaluation

- Use spells data to look in the future return rate and speed
- Link wage records and spell data to explore income and type of jobs at the time both before and after a spell is canceled 

* Some basic tasks in a data analysis project

- Cleaning the data
- Manipulating the data
- Create new /FeatureS/
- Create new views of the data
- Answering analytical questions

### Part II Machine Learning Models

- Predict the risk of return at a moment spell is canceled 
- Evaluate models based on different project goal
